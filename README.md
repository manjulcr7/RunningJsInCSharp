# Running JavaScript in C# using V8 Engine

This project demonstrates how to execute JavaScript code within a C# application using the V8 JavaScript engine. The V8 engine, developed by Google, is a high-performance JavaScript engine used in popular web browsers like Chrome.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework or .NET Core installed on your machine.
- NuGet package manager.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open the solution in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages.

4. Run the application.

## How it Works

The project uses the V8.Net library, which provides C# bindings for the V8 engine, enabling JavaScript execution within the C# environment.

1. Creating the JavaScript Engine

   ```csharp
   var engine = new V8ScriptEngine()
   ```

   - We create an instance of the `V8ScriptEngine` class, which represents the JavaScript engine.

2. Executing JavaScript Code

   ```csharp
   string javascriptCode = @"
       function add(a, b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       add(2, 3);
   ";
   
   var result = engine.Evaluate(javascriptCode);
   ```

   - Define your JavaScript code snippet as a string.
   - Use the `Evaluate` method of the `V8Engine` class to execute the JavaScript code.
   - The result is retrieved using the `Execute` method, and in this example, it's cast to an `int`.


## Customization and Further Development

- You can modify the JavaScript code in the `javascriptCode` variable to execute different JavaScript logic.
- Explore the Clearscript.V8 library's documentation for more advanced features and functionalities.
- Extend the project to include additional C# and JavaScript integration scenarios.
